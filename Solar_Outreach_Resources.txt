- Thank you for your interest in our solar outreach resources.

- The following resources include those described in our article 'Opening Pupil's Eyes to the Sun', in the December 2020 issue of Astronomy and Geophysics. 

- If you have any questions regarding these resources, notice any errors, or have direct criticism, please send them to Ryan French at ryan.french.14@ucl.ac.uk.

- Finally, we are aiming to track the number of students using these resources. To help us with this, we would appreciate you filling out the following short survey here - https://forms.gle/5c5LtrPCT4F4gshi9

- We plan to continue adding to the resource suite, and aim to add introductory Python exercises to the directory by the end of January 2021.

- The current suite of resources are available in the following Google Drive. To utilise the main product, the data analysis code, you will need to download the entire 'EIS_code' folder and reupload to your own drive. Instructions on how to use this code are given in the user guide (located in the same directory).
